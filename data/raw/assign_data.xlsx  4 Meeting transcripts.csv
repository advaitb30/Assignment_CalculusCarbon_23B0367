,T001,"Ana from VerdeNova joined the call to update us on their ARR project in Mato Grosso, Brazil. She mentioned they have already completed consultations with two of the three local communities, and the last one should wrap up by October. Their target area is around 1,200 hectares with expected credits of roughly 4,800 per year. Ana said the feasibility report should be finalized in Q1 2026. She also asked when Calculus could schedule a site visit to show the investors around the project area."
,T002,"Diego from EquiForests discussed their community-based reforestation program in Peru’s Ucayali region. There was some confusion between 850 and 830 hectares due to overlapping land parcels, which they are re-measuring. Julia from the investor side (NorthStar) asked about local community ownership and if the project is already registered with Verra. Manan explained that it’s still in feasibility and the first issuance is expected by 2027. They agreed to share updated topo maps in a week."
,T003,"Marites from BlueCanyon Agro presented updates on the AWD rice cultivation pilot in the Philippines. She mentioned the sensors were installed across five fields, but heavy rain disrupted data collection. Early data suggests around 20% water savings and a 12% increase in yield. Calculus will help them format the monitoring data and prepare it for submission to the Gold Standard validator."
,T004,"Sergey from SteppeRestore in Kazakhstan explained that their reforestation pilot is expanding to 2,500 hectares. They are integrating a timber harvesting component to generate early cashflows. Helios Infrastructure is reviewing the project as it fits their large-scale NbS investment criteria. Sergey requested assistance in setting up meetings with potential co-investors before the October field survey."
,T005,Batjargal from NorthernMethaneFix confirmed that their baseline methane measurements are scheduled for mid-October with vendor T1. Early leak detection tests show a 60% reduction potential in certain pipelines. He mentioned that Atlas Carbon Partners has shown interest but wants to see verified results before committing. There was also a discussion about drone-based leak detection as a possible upgrade for next year.
,T006,"Rahul from CarbonRoots India shared that they already have 4,000 hectares of leased land for the afforestation project. He noted that the project has begun generating minor timber revenues and could issue carbon credits by 2026. The team discussed blending debt and equity to attract investors like Summit Green or Triodos. Rahul emphasized that audited financials and lease documents are available in their data room."
,T007,"Lucia from AquaTerra presented the smallholder restoration program in Bahia, Brazil. The project now works with 220 farmers and plans to scale to 600 by the end of the year. Average income per farmer has already risen by 35%. VerdeVentures has expressed early interest for a small USD 2–3M ticket. Lucia asked for help preparing an impact summary that focuses on social outcomes and local employment generation."
,T008,"Putri from DeltaBiochar joined with her lab lead to present early data from their Sumatra pilot. Their biochar samples showed 42% carbon content and good structural stability, but permanence modelling still needs refinement. She mentioned that GreenBridge Capital might co-invest if permanence risks are clearly quantified. The lab will issue a full analytical report next week, and Calculus will review the data once available."
,T009,"Mamadou from SaharaGreen explained that their ARR project in Senegal is already registered and covers about 5,000 hectares. They are looking for investors to co-finance expansion to 7,000 hectares. A French foundation has offered a grant, but they want commercial partners who can commit to a 10-year offtake. Mamadou mentioned that Calculus could help identify potential buyers in Europe or Japan."
,T010,"Clara from AndesReforest spoke about delays in obtaining community land titles in Peru. One ejido has not yet given consent, but legal consultants expect resolution within three weeks. The project spans roughly 1,800 hectares and aims for around 7,000 credits per year. Clara asked for advice on whether to begin validation or wait until all titles are cleared. The team suggested starting pre-validation work meanwhile."
